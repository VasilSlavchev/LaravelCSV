You are provided with 2 CSV files:

candidates.csv - a list of candidate names and email addresses
jobs.csv - a list of the past 3 jobs for each candidate. A job contains the job title, company name, start and end dates. 

The task is to read this data using PHP7 in CLI mode and populate a MySQL database of 2 tables. The script should finish by printing out simple structured data for each candidate and their 3 jobs in the correct order, with most recent job first.

Guidelines: You will need to use the Laravel framework to complete this task, in particular your understanding of the Artisan command and Eloquent ORM features are of interest to us. Although the data set is very small, please create code that can deal with very large data sets that minimise the number of queries made to the database. Your code should be structured using object-oriented principles and should be committed to a publicly accessible GitHub account, or similar. Please do not do a single commit at the end of the task but commit frequently, so we can assess your overall approach.
